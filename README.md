# End-to-end encryption

## Overview

The End-to-end encryption option in ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors allows users to protect documents with a strong password generated automatically each time they save the documents and stored in the private network based on Parity.
Besides, it protects all the inputs while co-editing documents at both sides.  

## Functionality

* Reliable document encryption (AES-256);

* Support for all key formats: DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, ODT, ODS, ODX, PDF;

* Flexible access rights management: Full access, Review, Comment only, View only, etc.;

* Encrypted real-time co-editing;

* Ethereum private network with asymmetric encryption for reliable password storing and transferring.

The end-to-end encryption is available as a developer preview in ONLYOFFICE desktop applications - ONLYOFFICE Desktop Editors starting from version 5.2.7 for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
